# Resim: implementation instructions

Work only inside `CodeBTL/`. The neighbouring `CODE BTL/` is a separate directory.

Before working, read `docs/implementation-plan.md`. Then read the documents for your task:
- Frontend: `docs/frontend-spec.md` and `docs/api-contract.md`.
- Backend: `docs/backend-spec.md` and `docs/api-contract.md`.
- Integration or review: all three specifications.

`docs/api-contract.md` is authoritative for HTTP payloads, identifiers, parameter definitions, and errors. Propose discrepancies to the coordinator instead of changing the contract unilaterally.

The deliverable is an editor-first Next.js frontend and a FastAPI infrastructure scaffold. The eight image-processing features, pipeline, and AI advisor remain explicit unimplemented stubs. A successful upload is not a successful restoration.

Use Vietnamese for user-facing text and clear English identifiers in code. A local preview may display the original; result, comparison, download, and AI proposal states require real corresponding data. Do not manufacture that data.

Respect task ownership from the plan. Do not overwrite another agent's files. Include commands run, results, and any remaining limitations in the handoff.
